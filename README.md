# About Custom Menu

This is simple extension that will add custom menu popup to your chrome toolbar. It comes with some preset menu items but you can customise it to include anything you want.

I know, I know, the "Bookmarks" menu does the same, but I just needed something like that that I can put right in the toolbar and customise for my most used sites and chrome internal pages, hence I made this.

If you like the idea -- check it at the chrome web store (link below)
